# Friendly Captcha puzzle verification test

This react app continously 
- requests puzzles
- generates solutions
- verifies the solution
- counts up successes and failures, respectively

This requires you to expose your API Key in the Web App, which is not recommended.
This is only to be used to verify that the API works, and as an all inclusive example of how Friendly Captcha works.
